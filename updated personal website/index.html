<h1>Personal Profile Web page </h1>    

<p>Hi! My name is Christina Prado, I am a second-year college student in Asia Pacific College taking the course BSIT-MI.</p>  

<p>BSIT-MI, Bachelor of Science in Information Technology with specialization in Mobile and Internet Technologies</p>    

<p>When it comes to my experience with IT, I first learned to code using HTML when I was in 9th grade and I really enjoyed it,
and that encouraged me to take IT. I also really enjoyed creating an ERD Diagaram on our DATAMA! subject.</p>    

<p>My hobbies are exploring, walking, eating out with friends, cleaning, organizing, and interacting with my dogs</p>

<p>My goals in life are having multiple streams of income, be financialy stable, and living a long healthy life.</p>
